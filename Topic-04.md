# Part 1: The SSH protocol, key generation, configuration of user settings
## The SSH protocol:
- The SSH (Secure Shell) protocol is a network protocol that provides secure communication and remote administration capabilities over an unsecured network. 
- It allows users to securely connect to a remote server or device and execute commands, transfer files, and manage systems remotely. 
- SSH utilizes encryption and authentication mechanisms to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of the communication by ***running on top of the TCP protocol and always listens to the TCP/IP port number 22 by default***, and it is secure since it encrypts the data using encryption ***algorithms like Advanced Encryption Standard AES or Data Encryption Standard DES.***

In summary:
- Designed for secure remote access and control of systems over an unsecured network.
- Provides encrypted and secure communication between a client and a server.
- Typically used for secure remote login, file transfers, and remote command execution.
- Operates at the application layer of the network stack.

### Establishing an SSH connection
There are three key steps:
  
  1. Verification of server: The client initiates the SSH connection and verifies the authenticity of the server by checking its public key.
  
  2. Generation of a session key: Once the server is verified, both the client and server negotiate a session key using the Diffie-Hellman algorithm. This session key is a shared symmetric key that will be used for encrypting and decrypting the data exchanged during the session.

  3. Authentication of the client: The client sends its public-private key pair identification to the server. The server checks its authorized_keys file to determine if the client's ID exists there. If a match is found, the server generates a random number and encrypts it using the client's public key. The client, possessing the correct private key, decrypts the message and retrieves the random number. Using this random number and the shared session key, the client and server generate an MD5 or SHA-2 hash. The client sends this hash to the server, which can independently calculate the hash using the shared session key and original random number. If the calculated hash on the server matches the one received from the client, the client is successfully authenticated, and the connection is established.
  
## key generation:
- Key generation in the context of the SSH protocol is a crucial step in establishing a secure and encrypted connection between the client and the server. It involves the generation of cryptographic keys that are used for encryption and decryption of the data transmitted during the SSH session. To generate an SSH key pair, you can use the `ssh-keygen` command-line tool. Once generated, you will have two files: id_rsa (private key) and id_rsa.pub (public key). the id_rsa.pub should be placed in the remote systems authorized_keys directory in its .ssh hidden folder on its home directory, this directory must also have root permissions granted. Now whoever has the corresponding private key can login to this remote computer using ssh protocol.

- SSH utilizes asymmetric cryptography, which involves the use of a key pair consisting of a public key and a private key. The key pair is unique to each user or entity involved in the SSH communication. Here is an explanation of the key generation process:

    1. Key Pair Generation: The client and server each generate their own key pair. The key pair consists of a public key and a private key. The private key should be kept confidential and securely stored by the owner, while the public key can be freely shared.

    2. Public Key Distribution: The client sends its public key to the server. This can be done in various ways, such as manually copying the key to the server or using automated methods like SSH key management systems.

    3. Server Verification: Upon receiving the client's public key, the server verifies its authenticity. The server checks if the client's public key is listed in its authorized_keys file or any other trusted key storage mechanism. This ensures that only authorized clients with valid public keys can establish a connection.

    4. Shared Session Key: Once the server verifies the client's public key, both the client and server engage in a process called the Diffie-Hellman key exchange. This process allows them to derive a shared session key without directly transmitting it over the network. The shared session key is a symmetric key used for encryption and decryption during the SSH session.

    5. Encryption and Decryption: With the shared session key in place, the client and server can now encrypt and decrypt the data transmitted between them. The encryption algorithms used, such as AES or DES, ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the data.
   
## configuration of user settings:
- SSH configuration file (ssh_config): Users can modify this global configuration file to set options that apply to all SSH connections from their account.

- User-specific configuration file (~/.ssh/config): Users can create this file to override or supplement the global SSH configuration and define specific options for individual hosts or groups of hosts.

- Authentication methods: Users can configure their preferred authentication method(s) (e.g., password-based, public key, certificate-based) for SSH connections.

- Key-based authentication: Users can generate and configure SSH key pairs for more secure authentication, involving public-private key management and configuration.

- SSH agent: Users can configure their SSH agent settings to securely manage and handle private keys for convenient, passphrase-protected key authentication.

- Proxy settings: SSH can work through proxies like SOCKS or HTTP, and users can configure SSH to establish connections in restricted network environments.

- Tunneling and port forwarding: Users can configure SSH to create encrypted tunnels for secure network connections and access remote services through port forwarding.
