## <a name="_p2uk4xl36pgi"></a>**Diodes:**
A diode is a two-terminal electronic component that conducts electricity primarily in one direction. It has high resistance on one end and low resistance on the other end.

Diodes are used to protect circuits by limiting the voltage and also transform AC into DC. Semiconductors like silicon and germanium are used to make the most of the diodes.

We can get a diode by combining a P type material with N type material.

There are two terminals that are known as anode and cathode. The arrowhead is the anode that represents the direction of the conventional current flow in the forward-biased condition. The other end is the cathode.

The current should flow from the anode to cathode (+ of battery to anode), otherwise the current won't flow unless we apply very high voltage exceeding the threshold. Also the current should be flowing from the high voltage to lower voltage.

Power consumed by diode P=VI.

**Tunnel Diode:** A diode with a highly doped PN junction, exhibiting negative resistance. Used in microwave circuits, oscillators, and high-speed applications.

**Photodiode:** A diode that generates a current proportional to the incident light intensity. Used in light detection, optical communication, and sensing applications.

**Laser Diode:** A diode that emits coherent light through stimulated emission. Used in laser pointers, optical data storage, fiber optic communication, and medical devices.

**Light Emitting Diode (LED)**

When an electric current between the electrodes passes through this diode, light is produced. In other words, light is generated when a sufficient amount of forwarding current passes through it. In many diodes, this light generated is not visible as there are frequency levels that do not allow visibility. LEDs are available in different colors. There are tricolor LEDs that can emit three colors at a time. Light color depends on the energy gap of the semiconductor used.
## <a name="_xeaprzo2v8a3"></a>**Rectifiers:**
A rectifier is a device that converts an oscillating two-directional alternating current (AC) into a single-directional direct current (DC). Rectifiers can take a wide variety of physical forms, from vacuum tube diodes and crystal radio receivers to modern silicon-based designs.
### <a name="_aegwbfee5cco"></a>**Half-Wave Rectifier:**
The name half-wave rectifier itself states that the rectification is done only for half of the cycle. The AC signal is given through an input transformer which steps up or down according to the usage. Mostly a step-down transformer is used in rectifier circuits, so as to reduce the input voltage.

The input signal given to the transformer is passed through a PN junction diode which acts as a rectifier. This diode converts the AC voltage into pulsating dc for only the positive half cycles of the input.
### <a name="_lr4aktl30ujk"></a>**Full-Wave Rectifiers:**
If we need to rectify AC power to obtain the full use of both half-cycles of the sine wave, a different rectifier circuit configuration must be used. Such a circuit is called a full-wave rectifier.
### <a name="_b8a95p3erf9u"></a>**Rectification:**
An alternating current has the property to change its state continuously. This is understood by observing the sine wave by which an alternating current is indicated. It raises in its positive direction goes to a peak positive value, reduces from there to normal, and again goes to the negative portion and reaches the negative peak and again gets back to normal and goes on.

During its journey in the formation of a wave, we can observe that the wave goes in positive and negative directions. Actually, it alters completely and hence the name alternating current.

But during the process of rectification, this alternating current is changed into direct current DC. The wave which flows in both positive and negative directions till then, will get its direction restricted only to a positive direction when converted to DC. Hence the current is allowed to flow only in the positive direction and resisted in the negative direction.

The circuit which does rectification is called a **Rectifier circuit**.
## <a name="_auhqaqs1w9wg"></a>**DC to DC Converter:**
Introduction:
- DC to DC converters are electronic circuits that convert one DC voltage level to another DC voltage level.
- They are commonly used in various applications to provide voltage regulation, voltage conversion, and power conditioning.

Mechanism:
- DC to DC converters operate in different topologies, such as buck converters, boost converters, buck-boost converters, and more.
- Passive components like inductors and capacitors are used to store and regulate energy during the conversion process.
- Control techniques, such as pulse width modulation (PWM), are employed to regulate the output voltage and maintain stability and efficiency.

Advantages:
- efficient power conversion, allowing for high efficiency in voltage conversion.
- voltage regulation, ensuring a stable and consistent output voltage.
- flexibility in adapting power from one source to another, facilitating compatibility between different voltage requirements.

Examples:
- power supplies, battery chargers, renewable energy systems, electric vehicles, and many other devices and systems that require voltage conversion or regulation.

## <a name="_ewlgnenjq0gn"></a>**Voltage Regulator:**
A voltage regulator is an electrical or electronic device that maintains the voltage of a power source within acceptable limits. The voltage regulator is needed to keep voltages within the prescribed range that can be tolerated by the electrical equipment using that voltage. Such a device is widely used in motor vehicles of all types to match the output voltage of the generator to the electrical load and to the charging requirements of the battery.

Electronic voltage regulators utilize solid-state semiconductor devices to smooth out variations in the flow of current. In most cases, they operate as variable resistances; that is, resistance decreases when the electrical load is heavy and increases when the load is lighter.
### <a name="_b4rdeoaj905x"></a>**How does it work?**
The voltage regulator uses the principle of a feedback control system. It relies upon negative feedback control loops.

A reference voltage signal is provided to the comparator circuit along with the feedback signal from the controller. The comparator circuit compares both values and sends the error signal to the controller. The controller regulates the output voltage using the error signal from the comparator.
## <a name="_z6eiyg4oddc"></a>**Current Regulator:**
Unlike transforming (changing from one voltage level to another) which is usually one of the major reasons for voltage regulation, current regulation is usually about keeping the current that’s being supplied constant, irrespective of variations in load resistance or input voltage. The circuits (integrated or not) which are used to achieve constant current supply are called (Constant) Current Regulators.

Generally, a current regulator is a form of step-down transformer that allows only a set amount of current to pass through to the device. For example, computers typically require only 20 volts to operate and cell phones require only 3 volts. Current regulators in both cases are usually part of the cord that is plugged into the wall and then into the device.

Constant current regulators find applications in all sorts of devices from power supply circuits, to Battery charging circuits, to LED drivers and other applications where a fixed current needs to be regulated irrespective of the applied Load.
