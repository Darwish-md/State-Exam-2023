# Part 1: Programmable logic devices. Designing a digital system in hardware description language, and implementing it in FPGA devices.
## Programmable Logic Devices
- Programmable Logic Devices (PLDs) are integrated circuits that can be programmed to perform specific digital functions. They offer flexibility and reconfigurability, allowing designers to implement custom digital systems.
1. PLDs:
  - PLDs are electronic components that allow the creation of custom digital circuits.
  - Unlike fixed-function integrated circuits, PLDs have an undefined function initially and require programming or reconfiguration.

2. Advantages of PLDs:
  - Flexibility: PLDs offer reconfigurability, allowing experimentation and addition of new features without the need for new hardware designs.
  - Programmable Logic: PLDs have programmable logic, enabling the implementation of various digital functions.
  - Cost-Efficiency: PLDs are affordable and can be easily programmed and tested in live circuits.

3. Implementation of PLDs:
  - Logic Structure: PLDs typically consist of an array of AND gates and an array of OR gates, allowing the implementation of sum-of-product (SOP) logic functions.
  - Programming Technology: One common method is using fuses, where intact fuses represent "1" and blown fuses represent "0". The fuses are selectively blown to define the desired logic paths.

4. Types of PLDs:
  - Simple Programmable Logic Devices (SPLDs): Examples include ROM (Read-Only Memory), PLA (Programmable Logic Array), and PAL (Programmable Array Logic).
  - High-Capacity Programmable Logic Devices (HCPLDs): An example is the FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array), which offers a larger capacity and greater flexibility.
        
 ## Designing a digital system in hardware description language, and implementing it in FPGA devices
- Designing a digital system using hardware description languages (HDLs) and implementing it in Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) devices involves the following steps:

    1. Designing in Hardware Description Language:
        Select an HDL: Popular HDLs include VHDL (VHSIC Hardware Description Language) and Verilog. These languages allow designers to describe the behavior and structure of digital systems.
        Define the system architecture: Determine the desired functionality and structure of the digital system, such as the modules, input/output ports, and internal connections.
        Write HDL code: Use the selected HDL to write code that represents the desired behavior of the digital system. This includes designing modules, defining signals, specifying data flow, and implementing control logic.
        Simulate the design: Use simulation tools to verify the functionality and correctness of the design before proceeding to implementation.

    2. Synthesis:
        Perform synthesis: Synthesis tools analyze the HDL code and generate a netlist, which represents the circuit's structure using primitive logic elements available in the target PLD or FPGA.
        Optimize the design: Synthesis tools optimize the design by minimizing logic elements, reducing power consumption, and improving performance.

    3. Implementation in FPGA Devices:
        Select an FPGA device: Choose an FPGA device based on factors such as required logic capacity, I/O interfaces, speed requirements, and cost.
        Map the design to FPGA resources: Use place-and-route tools to map the synthesized netlist to specific logic elements, routing resources, and I/O pins on the chosen FPGA device.
        Generate programming files: The place-and-route tools generate programming files, such as a bitstream, that can be loaded onto the FPGA to configure it with the desired digital system.

    4. Testing and Verification:
        Test the implemented design: Verify the functionality of the digital system by running test vectors or applying stimuli to the input ports and observing the outputs.
        Debug and iterate: If any issues or errors are identified, debug the design, make necessary modifications, and retest until the desired functionality is achieved.

***Example***:
Suppose we want to design a simple 4-bit binary adder using VHDL and implement it in an FPGA device. Here's a high-level overview of the process:
1. Design in VHDL:
        Define the architecture: Create a module for the 4-bit binary adder, including input ports (A, B) and output ports (Sum, Carry).
        Write VHDL code: Implement the behavior of the adder using VHDL code, specifying the addition operation, carry calculation, and output generation.
2. Synthesis:
        Perform synthesis: Use a synthesis tool to convert the VHDL code into a netlist representation using the FPGA's logic elements (e.g., lookup tables, flip-flops).
        Optimize the design: The synthesis tool optimizes the design by minimizing logic elements and improving performance.
3. Implementation in FPGA:
        Select an FPGA device: Choose an FPGA device suitable for the design's logic capacity and I/O requirements.
        Map the design: Use a place-and-route tool to map the synthesized netlist to specific logic elements, routing resources, and I/O pins on the FPGA.
        Generate programming files: The place-and-route tool generates a bitstream file that can be loaded onto the FPGA to configure it with the binary adder design.
4. Testing and Verification:
        Test the implemented design: Apply test vectors to the input ports (A, B) and observe the outputs (Sum, Carry) to verify the correctness of the binary adder.
        Debug and iterate: If any issues are found, debug the design, make necessary modifications, and retest until the binary adder functions as intended.
        
# Part 2: Basic concepts of system engineering, different paradigms. Characteristics of the classical methods: waterfall, evolution, incremental, agile methods. Fundamentals and patterns of OOdesign. MVC
## Basic concepts of system engineering
- Systems engineering is a disciplined approach to designing, analyzing, and managing complex systems. It involves a systematic process that focuses on understanding the needs and requirements of stakeholders and creating solutions that meet those needs effectively. 

- In simple terms, systems engineering is like building a puzzle. Imagine you have a puzzle with many pieces, and you want to put them together to create a complete picture. Systems engineering is the process of figuring out how all the pieces fit together and work harmoniously to achieve a specific goal.

- The goal of systems engineering is to create reliable, efficient, and cost-effective systems that meet stakeholder needs. It involves considering various factors, such as technical feasibility, safety, reliability, cost, and schedule, throughout the entire lifecycle of the system. 

- Systems engineering have five core concepts, commonly known as VICAT:
1. Value: The primary goal of systems engineering is to provide value by meeting the needs and requirements of stakeholders. It is crucial to ensure that the system delivers the desired outcomes and benefits.

2. Context: Understanding the context in which the system will be deployed is essential. Engineers need to consider the specific environment, constraints, and user requirements to design a system that fits seamlessly into its intended operational context.

3. Trade-offs: During the design process, trade-offs must be carefully evaluated. These trade-offs involve factors such as cost, time, and performance. Engineers need to make informed decisions to strike the right balance between these elements to achieve an optimal solution.

4. Abstraction: Abstraction is a fundamental skill in systems engineering. It involves the ability to conceptualize and design a system independently of the specific solution. This allows engineers to focus on the system's architecture, functionality, and requirements without being tied to any particular implementation details.

5. Interdisciplinarity: Systems engineering embraces an interdisciplinary approach. It recognizes that complex systems require expertise from various disciplines to address all the stakeholders' requirements adequately. Teams comprising members from different fields collaborate to integrate their knowledge and perspectives into the system design process.

- Here are the key steps involved in systems engineering:
1. Understanding Stakeholder Needs: Systems engineers begin by gathering information from stakeholders, such as users, customers, and experts, to understand their needs, expectations, and requirements for the system.

2. System Analysis and Design: Based on the gathered information, systems engineers analyze and design the system. They break down the system into smaller components, define their interactions and functions, and develop a blueprint or plan for the system.

3. Integration and Implementation: Systems engineers coordinate the integration of the system's components, ensuring that they work together smoothly. They oversee the implementation process, ensuring that the system is built according to the design specifications.

4. Testing and Verification: Systems engineers conduct rigorous testing to ensure that the system functions correctly and meets the specified requirements. They verify that the system performs as intended and address any issues or bugs that arise.

5. Operation and Maintenance: Once the system is deployed, systems engineers monitor its performance, troubleshoot any problems, and provide ongoing support and maintenance to ensure its smooth operation.

## System Engineering Paradigms
1. Waterfall Model: A linear, sequential approach where each phase (requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment) is completed before moving to the next. Example: Developing a software application following a predefined plan from start to finish.
    
2. Evolutionary Model: A flexible approach that involves iterative development and refinement based on feedback. Example: Developing a software application in multiple iterations, gradually adding features and making improvements.

3. Incremental Model: Similar to the evolutionary model, but with well-defined increments or modules that are developed and integrated one at a time. Example: Building a large software system by dividing it into manageable modules and integrating them incrementally.

4. Agile Methods: A collaborative, iterative approach that emphasizes adaptability, customer involvement, and delivering working software in short iterations. Example: Scrum, where a development team works in sprints to deliver software features in regular intervals.

## MVC (Model-View-Controller):
MVC is a design pattern commonly used in software development.
- Model: Represents the data and business logic of the application.
- View: Provides the user interface for displaying information to the user.
- Controller: Handles user input, interacts with the model, and updates the view accordingly.
***Example:*** In a web application, the model would store data (e.g., user information), the view would display the web pages, and the controller would handle user actions (e.g., submitting a form).

## Fundamentals OO design
The four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:
1. Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data and methods (functions) together into a single unit called an object. It hides the internal implementation details of an object and exposes only the necessary interfaces or methods to interact with it. Encapsulation provides data protection and ensures that the object's state can only be accessed or modified through controlled means, promoting data integrity and security.

2. Inheritance: Inheritance allows the creation of new classes (derived classes or subclasses) based on existing classes (base classes or superclasses). The derived classes inherit the properties and behaviors of the base class, allowing code reuse and promoting the hierarchical organization of classes. Inheritance enables the modeling of "is-a" relationships, where a derived class is a specialized version of the base class, inheriting its attributes and methods while also adding new functionalities or modifying existing ones.

3. Polymorphism: Polymorphism refers to the ability of objects of different classes to respond differently to the same message or method call. It allows objects to exhibit different behaviors based on their specific class implementation. Polymorphism enables code flexibility and extensibility by providing a common interface that can be implemented by multiple classes. This allows for code reuse and promotes modular design, as different objects can be used interchangeably through their common interface.

4. Abstraction: Abstraction involves the concept of creating simplified and generalized representations of complex systems. It focuses on identifying the essential features and behaviors of an object or a system while hiding unnecessary details. Abstraction allows programmers to define abstract classes or interfaces that provide a blueprint for creating concrete classes. It enables the separation of the interface from the implementation, allowing for modularity, flexibility, and ease of maintenance.

## Patterns of OO design
Design patterns in object-oriented programming (OO) are reusable solutions to common problems that arise when designing and implementing software systems. They provide a structured approach to solving specific types of problems and promote code reusability, maintainability, and scalability.

1. Creational Patterns: These patterns focus on object creation mechanisms. They provide ways to create objects in a flexible and controlled manner. Examples include:
   - Singleton Pattern: Ensures that only one instance of a class is created.
   - Factory Pattern: Provides an interface for creating objects, but allows subclasses to decide which class to instantiate.
   - Builder Pattern: Separates the construction of complex objects from their representation.

2. Structural Patterns: These patterns deal with the composition of classes and objects to form larger structures. They help create relationships between objects and classes to achieve desired functionality. Examples include:
   - Adapter Pattern: Converts the interface of one class into another interface that clients expect.
   - Composite Pattern: Allows clients to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.
   - Decorator Pattern: Dynamically adds new functionality to an existing object.

3. Behavioral Patterns: These patterns focus on the interaction and communication between objects. They define how objects collaborate and fulfill their responsibilities. Examples include:
   - Observer Pattern: Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
   - Strategy Pattern: Defines a family of interchangeable algorithms and encapsulates each one, allowing them to be used interchangeably.
   - Command Pattern: Encapsulates a request as an object, allowing clients to parameterize clients with different requests.

By using these design patterns, developers can follow established best practices and solutions to common problems in software development. This improves code quality, promotes modular and maintainable code, and facilitates collaboration among developers working on the same project.
